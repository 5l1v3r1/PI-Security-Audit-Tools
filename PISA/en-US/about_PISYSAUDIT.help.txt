SHORT DESCRIPTION
        The PI Security Audit Tools are a set of scripts that perform a set of security
	validations.

LONG DESCRIPTION
        This project is a framework to baseline the security configuration of your PI System. 
	This tool framework is built as a PowerShell module containing cmdlets to perform 
	different calls to collect the data from the security settings of different requested 
	PI System components.

	A series of PowerShell script files (*.psm1) form a single module named PI System Audit 
	Module (or PISysAudit Module) once loaded. You will find one core script containing the 
	collection logic and four library scripts containing the validation logic for different 
	topics such as best practices to harden the machine, PI Server, etc. The module exposes 
	several cmdlets either used for the internal logic or the external interface with the 
	end-user.

	The PI System Audit Module (PISysAudit) requires PowerShell version 2 and later, it can 
	be executed locally or remotely and make use of existing command line utilities to 
	perform many tasks. This allows being compatible with many versions of the PI System.

	The current version of the PISysAudit module implements 16 validations covering: 
	machine (AU1XXXX), PI Server (AU2XXXX), PI AF Server (AU3XXXX) and SQL Server (AU4XXXX) 
	best practices with the PI System.

VALIDATION CHECKS AND COMPLIANCE CONDITIONS
		
	::MACHINE::

		AU10001 - Domain Membership Check  
			Validation Check: verifies that the machine is a member of an Active Directory Domain.   
			For Compliance: join the machine to an Active Directory Domain.  Use of a domain is 
			encouraged as AD provides Kerberos authentication and is our best available technology 
			for securing a PI System.  Furthermore, the implementation of transport security in the 
			PI System relies on Windows Integrated Security and AD to automatically enable higher 
			strength ciphers.

		AU10002 - OS SKU   
			Validation Check: verifies that the OS Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is appropriate for 
			production use.    
			For Compliance: SKU should match one of the following: 12, 13, 14, 29, 39, 40, 41 or 42.  
			These correspond to the following display names: 
				12 - Server Datacenter (core installation) 
				13 - Server Standard (core installation) 
				14 - Server Enterprise (core installation) 
				29 - Web Server (core installation) 
				39 - Server Datacenter without Hyper-V (core installation) 
				40 - Server Standard without Hyper-V (core installation) 
				41 - Server Enterprise without Hyper-V (core installation) 
				42 - Microsoft Hyper-V Server
			These SKUs were chosen to highlight the reduced attack surface area of a core 
			installation of Windows Server.

		AU10003 - Validate if Windows firewall is enabled    
			Validation Check: verifies that the Windows host based firewall is enabled.  
			For Compliance: enable the Windows firewall.  A firewall's effectiveness is heavily
			dependent on the configuration.  For PI specific port requirements, see: 
			https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB01162.
			For more general information on the Windows firewall, see "Windows Firewall with 
			Advanced Security Overview" on TechNet: 
			https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831365(v=ws.11).aspx.

	::PI DATA ARCHIVE::

		AU20001 - PI Data Archive Table Security  
			Validation Check: examines the database security of the PI Data Archive and flags any 
			ACLs that contain access for PIWorld as weak. 
			For Compliance: remove PIWorld access from all database security ACLs.  Note that prior
			removing PIWorld access, you need to evaluate which applications are relying on that 
			access so that you can grant those applications access explicitly.  

		AU20002 - PI Admin Trusts Disabled 
			Validation Check: verifies that the piadmin PI User cannot be used in a PI Trust.   
			For Compliance: disable Trusts with piadmin.  This can be done by checking "User 
			cannot be used in a Trust" in the Properties menu for the piadmin PI User.  To access
			this menu open use the Idenitities, Users, & Groups plugin in PI SMT, navigate to the 
			PI User tab, right click the piadmin entry and select Properties in the context menu.

		AU20003 - PI Data Archive Subsystem Version      
			Validation Check: verifies that the PI Data Archive is using the most recent release.   
			For Compliance: upgrade the PI Data Archive to the latest version, PI Data Archive 
			2016 (3.4.400.1162).  For more information, see the "Upgrade a PI Data Archive Server" 
			section of the PI Data Archive Installation and Upgrade Guide, Live Library: 
			https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v7/GUID-0BDEB1F5-C72F-4865-91F7-F3D38A2975BD. 
 
		AU20004 - Edit Days   
			Validation Check: verified that Edit Days is set. 
			For Compliance: set to a value greater than zero.  EditDays defines the number of past 
			days where events can be modified in the Snapshot or Archive databases. A zero value means 
			no time check is done.  For instructions to set EditDays, see "Modify the EditDays tuning 
			parameter" section in the PI Data Archive System Management Guide:
			https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v7/GUID-0865CC31-BF8C-4347-B717-15071ED51399. 
 
		AU20005 - Auto Trust Configuration    
			Validation Check: verifies that the autotrustconfig tuning parameter is set to create 
			either no trusts or a trust for the loopback automatically (127.0.0.1). 
			For Compliance: set the autotrustconfig tuning parameter to a value of 0 (do not 
			automatically create any PI Trust entries) or 1 (create the trust entry for the loopback 
			IP address 127.0.0.1 only). 
 
		AU20006 - Expensive Query Protection 
			Validation Check: verify that the PI Data Archive has protection against expensive queries. 
			For Compliance: set the archive_maxqueryexecutionsec tuning parameter to a value between 60 
			and 300.  For more information on this parameter and other that can protect against expensive 
			queries, see the knowledgebase article 3224OSI8 
			https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/3224OSI8  
 
		AU20007 - Check if explicit login is disabled 
			Validation Check: verifies that explicit login is disabled as an authentication protocol.    
			For Compliance: set the tuning parameter Server_AuthenticationPolicy to a value greater than 3.  
			This is equivalent to the third notch, "Disable explicit login", or higher on the Security 
			Settings plugin in PI SMT.    
 
	::PI AF Server::
 
		AU30001 - PI AF Server Service Account   
			Validation Check: verifies that the AF Server application service is not running as the account 
			Local System. 
			For Compliance: run the AF Server Application service as a user other than Local System.  In 
			order to change the user that the service is running as, open control panel, go to Programs, 
			Programs and Features, select the entry for the PI AF Server and click Change.  This will 
			launch the installer where you will be given the option to change configuration settings, 
			including the service account.
 
		AU30002 - Impersonation mode for AF Data Sets   
			Validation Check:  verifies the impersonation mode for external data tables. 
			For Compliance: set the Configuration Setting ExternalDataTablesAllowNonImpersonatedUsers to 
			false, thereby requiring impersonation for access to external tables.  This setting can be 
			changed by running the AFDiag utility with the /ExternalDataTablesAllowNonImpersonatedUsers- 
			flag.  For more information, see "AFDiag utility parameters" in the PI Live Library. 
			https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v7/GUID-7092DD14-7901-4D63-8B9D-4414C569EA5F.
 
		AU30003 - PI AF Server Service Access   
			Validation Check: verifies that the PI AF application server service does not have excessive 
			rights.  For Compliance: ensure that the account does not have the following privileges: 
			SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege and SeTcbPrivilege.  For information on these 
			rights and how to set them, see "User Rights" on TechNet:
			https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349804(v=ws.10).aspx.

	::SQL Server::
 
		AU40001 - SQL Server xp_CmdShell      
			Validation Check: verifies that SQL Server does not have xp_CmdShell enabled. 
			For Compliance: disable xp_CmdShell configuration option.  This option can be configured 
			using the Policy-Based Management or the sp_configure stored procedure.  For more 
			information, see: 
			https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190693.aspx.
 
		AU40002 - SQL Server Adhoc Queries    
			Validation Check: verifies that SQL Server does not have Ad Hoc Distributed Queries enabled.    
			For Compliance: disable Ad Hoc Distributed Queries configuration option.  This option can be 
			configured using the Policy-Based Management or the sp_configure stored procedure. For more 
			information, see: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187569.aspx.
 
 
		AU40003 - SQL Server DB Mail XPs      
			Validation Check: verifies that SQL Server does not have Ad Hoc Distributed Queries enabled. 
			For Compliance: disable Database Mail XPs configuration option.  This option can be configured 
			using the Policy-Based Management or the sp_configure stored procedure. For more information, 
			see: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms191189.aspx.
 
		AU40004 - SQL Server OLE Automation Procedures   
			Validation Check: verifies that SQL Server does not have OLE Automation Procedures enabled. 
			For Compliance: disable the OLE Automation Procedures configuration option.  This option can 
			be configured using the Policy-Based Management or the sp_configure stored procedure. For 
			more information, see: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms191188.aspx.
